## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

using the wrong styles will make your work really awful. I had to do a major research on some css properties which could be used in place of others like the rem, em etc. these properties really made my work turn out this awesome irrespective of which device it's being viewed on.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
